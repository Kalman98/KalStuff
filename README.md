# KalStuff
[![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/21b4d968-a2f1-427d-b2dd-5654f506281a)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-teammodding-kalstuff)

Files for a mod that adds random stuff.

If anyone has any good ideas for the mod, put them here, under the Suggestions section, along with your name if you want. To keep things organized, if you decide to implement an idea from here write a comment saying that you are doing so before you start. Example: " - add Cheetos(Chester): FritoLay is working on it". Once a feature is finished and implemented, please change the status to "[Finished]" and move it over to the Finished Suggestions section. Example: " - add dumplings: [Finished]"

UPDATE: We're trying to keep everything in KalStuff unique. Please, if you add an idea, make sure that it hasn't been done before. And if it has, make sure that your take on it is really unique(soda sipping is a good example). Thanks.

## Suggestions:

# Guys, could we try to move these to the Issue Tracker? I'm gonna delete them from the README either way. So hurry up.

 - [ideas here]
 
 - add day counter to tell you what day you are on(pianoman373): ParkerMc is working on it.

 - block in minecart like to make some thing like an RV but with minecarts and sticky blocks(ParkerMC)
 
 - A use for the end blocks and ender powder to create a sort of linking portal (pianoman373)
 
 - Carts pulled by horses (pianoman373)
 
 - Scuba goggles for night vision only undewater (pianoman373)
 
 - Shield variants. iron, diamond, round, etc. (pianoman373)
 
 - Soda overhaul, requiring more expensive materials and a carbonation machine. Drink fountain? (pianoman373)
 
 - Instead of having giant food blocks why not have a block that renders as a bundle of any item in the game you want. This would be great for aesthetics and item compression. Very hard, but never done before. (pianoman373)
 
 - Move moon flowers to a special biome with other unique plants and trees with no mob spawning. (pianoman373)
 
 - Custom mobs (maybe variants people expected for 1.10 such as the forest woodbeast?). Maybe special mobs that only spawn near bedrock? Stone creepers that can only be hurt with diamonds? I don't think any of us have done mobs before so that would be great to learn. (pianoman373)
 
 - Magma blocks that look like normal stone in the overworld might be cool (pianoman373)



## Finished Suggestions:

 - add moon flowers(nunyabiznis): [Finished]
 - add boxing gloves(nunyabiznis): [Finished]
