# KalStuff
Files for a mod that adds random stuff.

If anyone has any good ideas put them in here, along with your name if you want. To keep things organized, write a comment saying that you are implementing this idea before you start coding it. Example: " - add Cheetos(Chester): FritoLay is working on it".

UPDATE: We're trying to keep everything in KalStuff unique. Please, if you add an idea, make sure that it hasn't been done before. And if it has, make sure that your take on it is really unique(soda sipping is a good example). Thanks.
